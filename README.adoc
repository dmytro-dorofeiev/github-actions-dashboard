== Github Actions Dashboard

[NOTE]
====
This project is very much work-in-progress, it may work or not!
====

Custom dashboard application aggregating information from multiple
Github projects and their Actions.

Some notes about purpose and idea of this project:

- It's difficult to know a states of your actions if you have
  multiple projects, thus a need to get an aggregated view.
- Potentially we might want to do some calls against actions
  via Github api's what you currently can't do via Github's UI.
